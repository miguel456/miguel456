### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Glad you decided to check my profile out!

I started coding over four years ago; I had a great passion for science, outer space, and programming. Coding is my passion and this is what I do almost every day. I regret no hour spent coding; I really love it and appreciate the time I spend solving complex problems and devising a new strategy to do A and B. It's my brain food. I also spend some time fiddling with new modern website designs and [Adobe Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html).

Most of my code lives on a private [Gitea](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea) instance, so if you're looking for a portfolio, I'll add one here soon! This was when Github's private repo feature was still paid, so I had to host my private code somewhere else.

I have close to 40 projects hosted privately.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a human resources management system for game servers/communities. It's currently hosted on my Gitea instance, [here](https://code.spacejewel-hosting.com/spacejewelhosting/staffmanager). (Note: Master branch is on Codefreeze.)

I also work freelance, however, I'm not taking new projects at the moment. I've worked with several customers over the past few months and I enjoy implementing their ideas into reality.
